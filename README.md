This repository contains various small apps that I made. Each app does something different from the other. It's the best place to find basic code of android applications.

 So, if you have made any small app just for yourself or for learning, contribute it here. Repository contains my small projects too like a login app using firebase ,a radiogroup and intent example and a basic mapbox example.

Another use of this repository is that you can contribute ideas for android apps and if anyone likes the idea, they can pick it and start working on that idea.
